(Bachelor thesis) Interactive tutorials in machine learning - Web application that provides interactive and extensive visualizations of Naive Bayes classifier, Thesis + Tutorial.

### Abstract of Bachelor's Thesis - Interactive tutorials in machine learning (2018)
The aim of the bachelor thesis is to provide basic overview of machine learning and its used
approaches. The greatest emphasis will be placed upon classification methods, in which will be
used two different algorithms focusing on the text data in particular. The main task will be to
explain the processes of these algorithms to users in the simplest way possible through executable
document and interactive web application. Executable document will provide an interactive
programming environment in which practical tasks are solved with accompanying text and helpful
visualizations. The greatest attention will be paid to the Naive Bayesian classifier, along with
providing extensive interactive visualizations to allow deep tracking of its computational processes
through web application. By using interaction elements, we will be able to experiment with
different algorithm configurations and observe relationships between data samples and its attributes
via graphs.  

(Python, Dash framework, Jupyter Notebook, HTML, CSS)  
  
<b>Note:</b> Web application's code is outdated since it was implemented in the early stages of Dash framework. My version had been using experimental parts of library and there were other changes that broke the code. Might get updated sometime in the future.

### 2018 - Interactive tutorials in machine learning (bachelor thesis) 
Tutorial was created with interactive environment - Jupyter Notebook, in which fundamentals of machine learning were explained using two diﬀerent algorithms. Along with this tutorial, I have implemented interactive web application providing extensive interactive visualizations to allow deeper tracking of Naive Bayesian text classiﬁcation process. Using interactive elements it is able to experiment with diﬀerent algorithm conﬁgurations and observe relationships between data samples and its attributes via graphs. 
Used technologies: Python, HTML, CSS, Dash framework, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code
